The Nomster web application helps you find the best restaurants via user rating and reviews.  You can easily contribute to the database by adding a restaurant with its name, location, and description.  Other users can also add comments and upload photos to give more information.  Google Maps is also available to help users see the area the restaurant is in.

To run Nomster locally, you will need to have a virtual machine set up (such as Vagrant) and clone the GitHub files onto your PC.  Please feel free to give it a try!
